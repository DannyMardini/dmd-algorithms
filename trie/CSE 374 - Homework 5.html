</p><h2>Assignment goal</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will develop a more complex program using dynamic
  data structures. In doing so you will:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Gain  experience developing a larger system one part at a
	  time, testing as you go.</li>
	<li>Learn about  the trie  data structure, a version of
	  a search tree.</li>
	<li>Gain experience working with trees, structs, and dynamically allocated data.</li>
	<li>Gain more experience reading and processing text files in C.</li>

        <li>Practice writing simple Makefiles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will build programs to implement T9 predictive text,
  a text input mode available on cellphones. On a cellphone, each number from
  2-9 on the keypad represent three or four letters, the number 0 represents
  a space, and 1 represents a set of symbols such as { , . ! ? } etc. The numbers
  from
  2-9
  represent letters as follows:<br>
  <br>
  2 ABC <br>
  3 DEF <br>
  4 GHI <br>

  5 JKL <br>
  6 MNO<br>
  7 PQRS <br>
  8 TUV <br>
  9 WXYZ
</p><p>Since multiple letters map to a single number, many key sequences represent
  multiple words. For example, the input 2665 represents "book" and "cool",
  among other possibilities.</p>

<p>To translate from number sequences to words, we will use a data structure
  known as a trie. A trie is a multiway branching structure (tree) that stores
  the prefixes of sequences. As we travel down a path in the trie, we reach word
  sequences spelled
  out by the numbers along that path. Classic trie data structures have edges
  labeled with letters to store  prefixes of strings. But for this application,
  we used a compressed trie that has only 10 possible branches at each node
  instead of
  26, since the digits 0-9 represent
  the 26
    letters, space and symbols. Because of this, 
  an extra layer of complexity is needed to figure out the string represented
  by a path, which is the predictive component
  of T9.</p>
<p>For more information on the data structure trie, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">here</a> is
  a link to the Wikipedia article.</p>
<h2>Technical Requirements </h2>

<p>Implement in C a program t9. The command</p>
<pre>        t9 FILE</pre>
<p>should read in a dictionary file (<code>FILE</code>) that contains a list
  of words. Translate each word in the dictionary  into its numeric key sequence,
  then add the
  key sequence to your trie, with the word at the end of the path corresponding
to the digits. If a word with the same numeric  sequence already exists in
  the trie, add the new word to the trie as a link to a new node with an edge
  labeled '#' instead of one of the digits 2-9. (The words linked from a 
  node by the '#' edges essentially form a linked list of words that have the
  same numeric code.)
</p><p>For example, if the program reads the set of words "jello","rocks",
  and "socks" from
  the dictionary and adds it to an empty trie, the resulting trie should look
  like this:<br>
  <br>
  <img src="./CSE 374 - Homework 5_files/exampleTrie.jpg" width="800" height="630">
</p><p>
Once your program has read the dictionary and built the trie containing the words
  in it, it should start an interactive session. The user should be able to type
  numbers and the program should print out the word corresponding to the sequence
  of numbers entered. Your program should use the numbers
  typed
  by
  the
  user to traverse the trie that has already been created,  retrieve the word,
  and print it to the screen.  If the user then enters '#', the program should
  print the next word in the trie that has the same numeric value, and so forth.</p>

		<p>As an example, if we run the program using the above trie<code></code>,
		  an interactive session might look like this:<br>
        </p>
		<pre>Enter "exit" to quit.
Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
&gt; 76257
   'rocks'
Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
&gt; #
   'socks'
Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
&gt; 53556
   'jello'
Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
&gt; #
    There are no more T9onyms

Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
&gt; 76257#
   'socks'
Enter Key Sequence (or "#" for next word):
&gt; 76257##
	There are no more T9onyms
&gt;4423
	Not found in current dictionary.
&gt;exit
</pre>

        <br>
Note: Make sure your program properly handles the case if the user typing in
more "#"s
than
there
T9onyms!
        <p>We provide you with two text files, <code><a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse374/10sp/homework/T9files/smallDictionary.txt">smallDictionary.txt</a></code> and <code><a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse374/10sp/homework/T9files/dictionary.txt">dictionary.txt</a></code>

          (right-click on the links to download the files). Each  of these text
            files contains a list of words to be used in constructing a trie
            - the small one primarily for testing, and the large one for the
            final program. Translate each
          word
          in
          the
          file
          into
          its
          associated
          T9 key
sequence, and add the word to the trie. In the case of multiple words having
          the same key sequence <em>k</em>,
let the first word encountered in the text file be represented by the key sequence
          <em>k</em>, the next encountered represented by <em>k</em>#, the next <em>k</em>##,
          etc. For example, 2273 can represent acre, bard, bare, base, cape,
          card,
care, or case. To disambiguate,  acre would be represented by 2273, bard by 2273#,
          bare by 2273##,  and so forth. When a user inputs a key sequence,
          print
the appropriate word or words.</p>
        <p>Your trie data structure should contain nodes to represent the
          tree, and strings (char arrays) containing copies of the words read
          from
          the dictionary file, linked to appropriate nodes in the trie.</p>
        <p>Besides the general specification given above, your program should meet the following requirements to
receive full credit.</p>
<ol>
<li>You should create a <code>Makefile</code> and use <code>make</code> to compile
  your program. Your <code>Makefile</code>  should only recompile the necessary
  part(s) of the program after changes are made.</li>

<li>Use <code>malloc</code> to dynamically allocate the nodes, strings, and
  any other data that make up your trie.</li>
<li>If you need to create a copy of a string or other variable-size data, you
  should dynamically allocate an appropriate amount of storage using <code>malloc</code> and
  return the storage with <code>free</code>    when you are done with it. The amount allocated should be based on the
  actual size needed, not some arbitrary size that is assumed to be "large enough".</li>
<li>Use standard C library functions where possible; do not reimplement operations available in the
         basic libraries.</li>
<li>If an error occurs when opening or reading a file, the program should write
  an appropriate error message to <code>stderr</code> and terminate if there
  is no further work to be done.</li>

<li>Before the program terminates, all dynamically allocated data must be properly
  freed (i.e., <code>free</code> everything acquired with <code>malloc</code>).</li>
<li>Your code must compile and run without errors or warnings when compiled with
  <code>gcc -Wall</code> on a recent version of <code>gcc</code>. Your program should build
  without errors when
  <code>make</code> is used  to run your <code>Makefile</code>.</li>

</ol>
<h2>Code Quality Requirements</h2>
<p>As with any program you write, your code should be readable and understandable to anyone who knows
C. In particular, for full credit your code must observe the following requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li>Divide your program into suitable source files (at least two) and functions,
  each of which does a single well- defined aspect of the assignment. For example,
  there should almost certainly be a header and  source file
        for the trie data structure and the operations needed on it (create a
  new empty trie, insert a word, search, free (delete) the trie, etc.). Your
  program most definitely may not consist of one huge main function that does
  everything. </li>
<li>The header (<code>.h</code>) file for the trie (and any other header files) should only
  declare items that are shared between client programs that use the header and
  the file(s)
  that implement it. Don't include in the header file implementation details
  that should be hidden. Be sure to use the standard <code>#ifndef</code> preprocessor
  trick so your header files work properly if included more than once in a source
  file,
  either directly or indirectly.</li>
<li>Be sure to
          include appropriate function prototypes near the beginning of each
  source file for functions whose declarations are not included in a header 
    file.</li>

<li> Comment sensibly, but not excessively. You should not use comments to repeat the obvious or
        explain how the C language works - assume that the reader knows C at least as well as you do.
        Your code should, however, include the following minimum comments:
             <ul><li>Every function must include a heading comment that explains what the function does
                  (not how it does it), including the significance of all parameters. It must not be necessary
                  to read the function code to determine how to call it or what happens when it is called.
                  (But these comments do not need to be nearly as verbose as, for example JavaDoc
                  comments.)</li>
             <li>Every significant variable must include a comment that is sufficient to understand what
                  information is stored in the variable and how it is stored. It must not be necessary to read
                  code that initializes or uses a variable to understand this.
        In addition, there should be a comment at the top of the file giving basic identifying
        information, including your name, the date, and the purpose of the file.</li>
             <li>Every source file should begin with a comment identifying the
               file, author, and purpose (i.e., the assignment or project).</li>
        </ul>
</li><li> Use appropriate names for variables and functions: nouns or noun phrases
  suggesting the contents of variables or the results of value-returning functions;
  verbs or verb phrases for <code>void</code>    functions that perform an action
  without returning a value. Variables of local significance like loop counters
  or indices should be given simple names like <code>i</code> or <code>n</code>

  and do not require further comments. Avoid names like <code>count</code> or <code>flag</code> that
  provide no useful information - use names that suggests the values being counted
  or
  the condition that is represented.</li>
<li>No global variables. Use parameters (particularly pointers) appropriately.
  Exception: if you wish, you may have global variables that record the settings
  of any command-line options added for the extra credit part (if you create
  any of these). It is also appropriate to use global variables for constant
  data like translation tables if the program is better structured this way.</li>
<li>No unnecessary computation or excessive use of <code>malloc</code> or <code>free</code>  -
  these are expensive. Don't make unnecessary copies of large data structures;
  use pointers. (Copies of
        ints, pointers, and similar things are cheap; copies of large arrays
  and structs are expensive.)</li>

</ol>
<h2>Implementation Hints</h2>
<ol>
<li>There are a lot of things to get right here; the job may seem overwhelming
  if you try to do it all at once. But if you break it into small tasks, each
  one of which can be done individually by
        itself, it should be quite manageable. For instance, figure out how to
  add a single word to the trie  before you implement the logic
  to process all the words in the
       dictionary. Figure out how to add a few words that have different numeric
  codes before you implement the code to handle words that have
  the same  codes. Implement the code to traverse the
  trie to
  translate
  an
  input
  key sequence
  into the
  corresponding word once you've built the trie, not before.</li>
<li>Before you start typing code, spend some time sketching out data structures
  and code (particularly trie node <code>struct</code>s) on paper or on a whiteboard.
  Be sure you understand what you are trying to do before you start typing.</li>
<li>Every time you add something new to your code (see hint #1), test it. <strong>Right
    Now!</strong> It is much
       easier to find and fix problems if you can isolate the potential bug to
    a small section of code you just added or changed. <code>printf</code> and
    <code>gdb</code> are your friends here to examine values while debugging.</li>

<li>You will probably find it very useful to include code that can print the
  contents of the trie in some understandable format. This is not required, but
  how can you be sure your code is correct if you can't look at the trie that
  is built for a small set of input data?</li>
<li>To build the trie, you need some way to translate characters (primarily letters)
  from words in the dictionary file to the correspoinding keypad digits. It
  is probably a great idea to include in your code a function that takes a character
  as
  an argument and returns the corresponding digit. This can be implemented with
    a series of <code>if-elseif-else</code> statements, but another way to do
    it is to have an
    array with one entry for each possible character. In the entry for each character,
   store the corresponding digit code. Then you can look up the code for a 
  character without a complicated nest of <code>if</code> statements. (Recall
   that in C, as in similar languages, a character can
  be
    used as a small integer. That is particularly helpful for exactly this kind
    of application, where we might like to use a character as an index value
  into a table of data.)</li>
<li>Be sure to check for errors like trying to open a nonexistent file to see if your error handling is
       working properly.</li>
<li>Once you're done, read the instructions again to see if you overlooked anything.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Extra Credit</h2>

<p>A small amount of extra credit will be awarded for adding the following extensions
  to an already complete, working assignment. No extra credit will be awarded
  if the basic program is not fully
implemented and substantially bug-free. You should also turn in your working
  assignment before attempting any extra credit, and turn in a second archive
  contining the enhanced program later (see instructions below).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add the functionality to allow users to give a prefix of a word as input
      instead of requiring entry of complete words. When a '#' is entered, if
      the numbers entered so far are only the prefix of a word, the program should
      print a word that begins with this prefix. (i,e, if '22' is
      the input and the user enters '#', 
      the
      output
      might
      be
      cab;
      if the user
      types "#" again, the
      output might be cap;"##" : car ,...etc., depending on how the words are
      stored in the dictionary)</li>
	<li>    Store the words in the trie so that if a numeric sequence matches several
	  possible words, the most likely word is presented first, based on how frequently
	  different words with the same numeric sequence actually appear in English
	  text. The data file <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse374/10sp/homework/T9files/freq_Dictionary.txt"><code>freq_Dictionary.txt</code></a> (right-click
	  to download) contains a list of words with, in addition, the frequency
	  of each word in ordinary
	  text. Use the information
	  in this file to construct your trie so the most likely words are reached
	  first.  Warning: the data in this file has some problems, like duplicate
	  entries for some words.  You will need to figure out how best to use this
	  data, or find different data that is more helpful.
	</li><li>Dynamically update the frequencies of  words in the trie. The idea here
	  is that if someone uses a particular word often, it should be presented
	  first before other words that have the same numeric code. To do this, you
	  need to rearrange the trie as the program runs so that frequently used
	  words move to locations higher up in the trie. Or you might want to change
	  the trie so that words with the same numeric spelling are stored as a linked
	  list anchored at a single trie node that represents that sequence of numbers.</li>
    <li>Feel free to experiment with additional extensions.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you include extensions in your program, you should also include a <code>README</code>  file
  that describes what you added and how to demonstrate your addition(s) when
  your program is executed.</p>
<h2>Test Sequences:</h2>
<p>The sequences below can be used to validate your trie against the given dictionary.</p>
<ol>
<li>22737: acres, bards, barer,bares,barfs,baser,bases,caper,capes,cards,carer,cares,cases</li>
<li> 46637: goner,goods,goofs,homer,homes,honer,hones,hoods,hoofs,inner</li>
<li>2273: acre, bard,bare,barf,base,cape,card,care,case</li>
<li>729: paw,pax,pay,raw,rax,ray,saw,sax,say</li>
<li>76737: popes,pores,poser,poses,roper,ropes,roses,sords,sorer,sores</li>
</ol>
<h2>What to turn in</h2>
<p>Create an uncompressed tar file containing your source code and <code>Makefile</code>,
  and submit that using the normal class dropbox. If you do any extra credit
  extensions later, create a second tar file with the word "extra" in the archive
  name containing the extra-credit version of your source code, <code>Makefile</code>,
  and the <code>README</code> file
  describing your extensions. Turn in that second archive in addition to the
first archive containing containing the solution to the main part of the assignment.</p>
